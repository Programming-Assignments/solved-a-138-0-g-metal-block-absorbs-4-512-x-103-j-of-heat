 <li>tA pulley system is used to raise a 140.0 N crate 6.5 m from the loading dock to the ship. This requires a force of 80.0 N to be applied by the longshoreman.

  <ul>

   <li>What is the mechanical advantage of the pulley system?</li>

   <li>What is the efficiency of the system if the ideal mechanical advance of the system was equal to 3?</li>

   <li>Find both the work input and work output assuming the efficiency found in part b.</li>

 <li>A 600.0 kg roller coaster car is at rest at the top of a 110.0 m hill. It rolls down the first drop to a height of 40.0 m then goes up the next hill where it is moving at 30.0 m/s at the top. It then rolls down the second hill until it is at ground level. Draw a picture of the roller coaster (there should be 2 hills) and calculate the kinetic and potential energy at the top and bottom of each hill. Label your work clearly.  You should have 4 locations with both KE and PE energy shown.</li>
